<div class="text-block well">

    <p><strong>Dentvault</strong> was created to solve the problem of digital dentistry.</p>
    
    <p>CT scans, Panoramics, treatment plans, STL files, and videos are just a few of the digital examples that are strewn between the lab, 
    the scan center and dentists either somewhere in cyberspace or on the computer in the "other office" on the "other device" or on the 
    computer that just crashed. </p>
    
    <p><strong>Dentvault</strong> makes all your digital files extremely accessible by placing them at your fingertips where ever you are, while keeping them 
    extremely secure in your private online vault. All your files are organized, noted, and taged wherever and whenever you need. </p>
    
    <p><strong>Dentvault</strong> organizes your digital dentistry world. </p>
